                <p><b>Fashion design:</b> is the art of applying design, aesthetics, clothing construction and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories. It is influenced by culture and different trends, and has varied over time and place.</p>
                <p><b>Who’s a Fashion Designer?</b>
    Fashion designers guide the process from inception to production.
    
    A fashion designer creates the specific look of individual garments-including a garment’s shape, color, fabric, trimmings, and other aspects of the whole.
    The fashion designer usually begins with an idea of how a garment should look, turns that idea into a design (such as a sketch), and specifies how that design should be made into an actual piece of clothing by other workers (from patternmakers to finishers).
    
    Fashion designers create design samples with or without the aid of a sewer; discuss their ideas with clients, fashion marketers and managers, discuss ideas with textile companies to buy best suitable fabric, draw eye catchy designs for accessories and garments, make suggestions to sketching assistants and pattern makers to assemble designs and make alterations.
    
    While sewing and pattern-making skills are beneficial, they are not a pre-requisite of successful fashion design.
    
    Most fashion designers are formally trained or apprenticed.
    
    One can earn a nice income if working under a major or productive fashion design company or label. Most fashion designers prefer to be self-employed.</p>
